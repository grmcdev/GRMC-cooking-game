# Minecraft Kitchen Rush: Developer Overview

## Elevator Pitch
Minecraft Kitchen Rush is a fast-paced, pixel-art kitchen management game inspired by the high-energy chaos of arcade cooking titles. Players step into Chef Gordon Ramsay's blocky shoes to prepare iconic Minecraft-inspired dishes against the clock while a harmless zombie sous-chef roams the kitchen making playful groans. Tight time limits, escalating order complexity, and score-driven goals encourage players to optimize their cooking flow, master the kitchen layout, and chase high scores across a campaign of handcrafted services.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Receive Orders** – Each service introduces a queue of Minecraft recipes with easy, medium, and hard difficulty tiers. Order cards communicate required ingredients, prep steps, and point rewards at a glance.
2. **Gather & Prep** – Players collect ingredients from fixed kitchen stations, chop and combine them, and interact with cooking appliances to transform them into finished components.
3. **Cook & Assemble** – Timing matters: overcooked items must be restarted, while optimal sequencing keeps the kitchen humming. Completed dishes earn score based on difficulty.
4. **Deliver & Repeat** – Serve finished meals to bank points, clear station clutter, and keep up with the flow of new orders until the service timer expires.

## Campaign Structure
- **Level 1 – Tutorial Service**: 3-minute service, 32-point target. Introduces one easy, one medium, and one hard recipe to teach station flow and scoring.
- **Level 2 – Dinner Rush**: 4-minute service, 100-point target. Expands the order list and increases recipe complexity to encourage strategic prioritization.
- **Level 3 – Grand Finale**: 4-minute service, 130-point target. Demands expert multitasking and efficient use of every station before revealing a "more content coming soon" teaser from BigRigDev.

All levels share a consistent kitchen layout so players can learn optimal routes and muscle memory. Ingredient crates, prep counters, cooking appliances, and plating stations remain in fixed positions throughout the campaign.

## Audience & Platforms
- **Target Players**: Fans of cooperative and solo cooking games (e.g., Overcooked) who enjoy time-management challenges, score chasing, and playful references to Minecraft.
- **Platforms**: Designed for browser play with responsive mouse and touch controls, enabling frictionless access on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Session Length**: Each level delivers a snackable 3–5 minute run ideal for casual play sessions, livestream challenges, or competitive scoreboards.

## Monetization & Live Ops Potential
- **Base Release**: Free-to-play browser experience to build community and collect feedback.
