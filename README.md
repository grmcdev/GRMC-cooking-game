# Gordon's Blocky Kitchen Brigade

A retro-leaning browser management game inspired by Overcooked where you guide pixelated Gordon Ramsay through a Minecraft-style
kitchen. Three escalating services (3, 4, and 4 minutes long) challenge you to clear specific score targets by completing
Minecraft-inspired recipes before their order timers expire. The kitchen supports mouse clicks and mobile taps.

## Game loop

- **Grab ingredients** from the supply crates on the left wall.
- **Prep** anything that needs chopping on the cutting boards.
- **Cook** items on the matching stove type (skillet or cauldron) until they hit the cooked stage.
- **Plate and serve** finished ingredients at the plating counter to fill customer orders. Clear every ingredient on a ticket to
  bank the recipe's point value before its personal timer runs out.
- **Keep moving!** Wandering zombie sous-chef adds ambience with random groans while you chase high scores.

The project uses the Phaser 3 engine to deliver a Unity-like scene flow within the constraints of a lightweight web build, so it
remains easy to run locally while still providing a structured engine-driven experience.

## Levels & scoring

- **Level 1 – Tutorial Service (3 minutes, goal: 32 pts):** Serve one easy, one medium, and one hard recipe to learn the flow.
- **Level 2 – Dinner Rush (4 minutes, goal: 100 pts):** Maintain a steady rhythm as overlapping tickets demand quick multitasking.
- **Level 3 – Chef Showdown (4 minutes, goal: 130 pts):** Keep every station humming to break the final score threshold and view
  the BigRigDev thank-you message while future content is still in development.

Recipe difficulty determines its value: easy dishes award 6 points, medium dishes give 10 points, and hard dishes deliver 16
points. Clearing a level requires meeting or exceeding its point target before time expires.

## Running locally

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern desktop or mobile browser. No build step is required.
3. Tap or click stations to direct Gordon around the kitchen and push your service score as high as possible before time expires.

## How players access the live game

When the bundle is hosted on your site with the GRMC gate enabled, the player experience follows these steps:

1. **Click the "Play" link/button on your website.** Open the game in a new browser tab so it can request wallet access without pop-up blockers interfering.
2. **Wallet prompt appears immediately.** The fullscreen gate (powered by `wallet-gate.js`) lists the supported Solana wallets and explains that GRMC ownership is required.
3. **Player connects their wallet.** After selecting Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, or another adapter, the wallet asks for permission to share the public key with the page.
4. **GRMC balance is verified.** The gate queries the configured RPC endpoint for SPL token accounts that match your GRMC mint address and confirms the player meets the minimum balance policy.
5. **Access granted or denied.**
   - If the balance requirement is satisfied, the overlay fades out, Phaser boots, and the kitchen loads Level 1.
   - If the wallet lacks GRMC, the overlay shows a friendly denial message and optional links where the player can acquire tokens before retrying.
6. **Play the three-level campaign.** With Gordon on the floor, players use mouse clicks or taps to prep ingredients, cook recipes, and chase each level's score target. Completing Level 3 triggers the in-development finale message from BigRigDev.

## Hosting on your website

Because the project is a static HTML/JS/CSS bundle, you can deploy it with any static host:

- **Traditional web servers:** Copy the repository contents to the public directory of Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc. Ensure the files are
  served over HTTPS for best mobile compatibility.
- **Static site platforms:** Drop the files into Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, or similar. Point the platform at the
  repository (or a deployment branch) and configure the build command to `None` so the files are shipped as-is.
- **Self-hosted object storage/CDN:** Upload to an S3-compatible bucket, enable static-site mode, and map your domain via DNS.

Whichever route you choose, the entry point is `index.html`. If you later introduce routing, configure the host to redirect unknown
paths back to that file so Phaser can boot correctly.

## Adding leaderboards

Keeping per-level leaderboards requires a small backend or serverless function that can store scores. A minimal architecture looks like:

1. **API endpoint:** Create a `/scores` endpoint (REST or GraphQL) that supports `POST` for submitting `{ playerName, levelId, score }`
   and `GET` for retrieving the top entries per level. Serverless functions (Netlify Functions, Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda) keep
   this lightweight.
2. **Persistence layer:** Use a managed database such as Firebase Realtime Database, Supabase/Postgres, or Fauna. Store level ID,
   player name/handle, score, and timestamp. Add indexes on `(levelId, score)` so you can fetch the top N scores quickly.
3. **Client integration:** Extend `game.js` to hit the `/scores` endpoint when a service ends. Fetch and render the current leaderboard
   in a HUD panel or modal. Cache responses client-side so the UI remains responsive between network calls.
4. **Anti-cheat considerations:** Require authenticated users (email/password, OAuth, or wallet-based login), validate scores on the
   server (e.g., ensure duration matches the level's timer), and rate-limit submissions.

## Connecting the GRMC Solana token

To tie the GRMC memecoin into the game economy and create demand:

- **Wallet gating:** Require players to connect a Solana wallet via libraries like `@solana/web3.js` and `@solana/wallet-adapter`. Offer
  cosmetic rewards or access to special events for wallets holding a threshold of GRMC tokens.
- **On-chain rewards:** Emit GRMC token drops when players complete weekly challenges or place on the leaderboard. Use a backend to sign
  transactions or integrate with custodial services that can send tokens securely.
- **In-game shop:** Introduce a cosmetics or boost store where purchases are denominated in GRMC. Process payments through Solana smart
  contracts or an off-chain order flow that settles on-chain.
- **Token sinks:** Offer limited-time events, kitchen themes, or premium levels that consume GRMC to enter, ensuring ongoing token
  utility.

### GRMC holder-only access

If you want the game to be playable *only* by wallets that currently hold GRMC, you will need a few concrete pieces of
information and infrastructure:

1. **Token metadata:** Share the GRMC mint address, decimals, and (optionally) the minimum balance that should unlock access.
   Without that data the client cannot determine which token account to inspect or how much constitutes "holding".
2. **Preferred Solana RPC endpoint:** Provide an RPC URL (Helius, Triton, QuickNode, or your own node). The client/ backend will
   query it to fetch token balances. If you expect high traffic, budget for a dedicated plan so rate limits do not block players.
3. **Wallet adapter configuration:** Decide which wallets must be supported (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, etc.) so the
   `@solana/wallet-adapter` layer can be configured ahead of time.
4. **Access policy:** Confirm whether access is gated on *any* GRMC balance, a minimum token amount, or ownership of a specific
   NFT receipt. This drives the logic the backend will enforce.

With those inputs the flow works like this:

1. Player loads the site and is presented with a "Connect Wallet" prompt before gameplay initializes.
2. After the wallet connects, the client requests the list of SPL token accounts for that wallet and filters them for the GRMC
   mint. (You can do this directly in the browser or via a thin backend proxy to keep your RPC key private.)
3. If the balance meets your access policy, unlock the Phaser boot sequence; otherwise show a friendly modal explaining that GRMC
   is required to play and link to an exchange or mint page.
4. Optionally, repeat the balance check periodically (e.g., every few minutes) to ensure the player keeps holding the minimum.

When you are ready to ship, supply the above metadata, RPC endpoint, and policy so the gating hook can be wired into
`index.html` / `game.js` alongside the existing wallet-connected leaderboard code path.

#### Configuring the live gate in this build

This repository now includes a gate overlay (`wallet-gate.js`) that blocks Phaser from starting until the connecting wallet
proves it holds GRMC. To make it production-ready:

1. Open [`index.html`](./index.html) and update `window.GRMC_GATE_CONFIG.mintAddress` with the actual GRMC SPL token mint.
2. Replace the default RPC endpoint if you have a preferred Solana provider (Helius, QuickNode, Triton, etc.).
3. Adjust `minTokenBalance` if holding any fraction of GRMC should unlock play (set to `0.000001` for "any amount").
4. (Optional) Set `window.GRMC_GATE_CONFIG.autoConnectTrusted = false` if you do **not** want the page to auto-detect previously
   approved wallets on load.
5. Upload the updated bundle to your host. When players click the link on your website, the new tab will immediately show the
   wallet prompt, validate the GRMC balance, and only then boot the kitchen.

### Wallet-connected leaderboard flow

1. Add a persistent **Connect Wallet** button to the HTML overlay so desktop and mobile players can authenticate with Phantom,
   Solflare, Backpack, or other Solana wallets via the wallet adapter.
2. When a run ends, request the player sign a nonce and submit `{ levelId, score, runDuration, signature }` to your backend. The
   backend validates the signature against the player's public key before accepting the score.
3. Store scores in a fast database for instant refresh, then optionally batch the day's top entries onto an on-chain Solana
   program (PDA) so fans and tournament organizers can independently audit leaderboards.
4. Expose both views in-game: an immediate feed pulled from the database and a "verified" tab that reads the PDA so players can
   see which scores are anchored on-chain.

### GRMC-powered extras

- **Cosmetic storefront:** Serve a JSON catalog of skins/emotes priced in GRMC. When a player buys an item, have the backend build a
  transaction transferring the token amount to the treasury for the player to sign.
- **Premium events:** Gate special weekend levels or score-chasing tournaments behind a GRMC entry fee and distribute prizes via a
  Solana program.
- **Holder boosts:** Detect token balances when the wallet connects and grant in-game perks (e.g., +10% score multiplier) to wallets
  meeting a threshold.

See [`BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION.md`](./BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION.md) for a deeper blueprint that blends off-chain responsiveness with
verifiable on-chain checkpoints, plus operational tips (custodial wallets, compliance, analytics) to keep the experience smooth.

When adding wallet support, host over HTTPS, follow Solana best practices for signing/transaction handling, and communicate clearly how
player data and tokens are used. Pair the token integration with marketing beats (weekly tournaments, collaboration drops) to keep
interest high.
